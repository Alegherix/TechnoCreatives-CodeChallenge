# Getting Started

Read the ASSIGNMENT.md. The frontend is prepared in `frontend/` and the backend is prepared as a stubbed file: `index.js`. 

## Commands to run the project

* `npm install`, this will install both backend and frontend dependencies
* `npm start`, this will make a production build of the frontend and start the server through `index.js`. Backend is served at `http://localhost:4000`
* `npm run dev`, this will start the backend and a development build of the frontend. React usually serves the app at `http://localhost:3000`

## Special considerations

Make sure that any dependencies you wish to use are installed on the correct level, the frontend has its own set of node packages. 

## Further information

Take a look at `frontend/README.md` for help with React toolchain scripts.
